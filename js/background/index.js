/**
 * Entry point for the background service worker
 * Import all modules and expose them as needed
 */

// Import the main background script
import './background.js';

// This file is intentionally simple - it just serves as an entry point
// that imports the main modules. This pattern allows for better code
// organization and makes it easier to add new modules in the future.
